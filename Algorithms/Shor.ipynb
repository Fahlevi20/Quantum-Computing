    "A pretty well-known problem in computer science is the problem of encryptying messages, i.e, given a message $m$, a sender $A$ and a receiver $B$, we want to send the message $m$ encrypted, so that only $B$ will be able to decrypt the information sended from $A$. We can ilustrate this situation by a simple example: Lets suppose Alice wants to send her secret chocolate cake recipe to Bob, but the message will be stolen if the used information channel is unsafe, and her archenemy, Eve, will finally find out Alice's delicious secret chocolate cake recipe. And we know that both Alice and Bob have lots of padlocks, but they don't share any of its keys. Hence from that we got our main problem.\n",
