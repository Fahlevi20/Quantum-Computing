    "In Quantum Computing the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), is the quantum analogue of the classical Fast Fourier Transform, which define a linear transformation on a string of qubits, that applies controlled phase shifts onto a superposition state. This operation is pretty well-known for its importance on many Quantum Algorithms, notably Shor's Algorithm, for factoring and computing the discrete logarithm, Quantum Phase Estimation for estimating the eigenvalues of a unitary operator, and algorithms for the hidden subgroup problem.\n",

We have that our goal is to find the value $r$ that defines the period.\n",

    "In order to extract this information from a quantum state on $n$ qubits, which in superposition give us $N = 2^n$ states, we can use the Quantum Fourier Transform and implement it in a Quantum Computer with $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ elementary gates. Therefore, giving us an exponential speed up when compared with the classical Fast Fourier Transform, which takes $\\mathcal{O}(NlogN) = \\mathcal{O}(2^nn)$ to solve the problem. However both functions don't have the same output, since QFT wonâ€™t give us the entries of the Fourier transform written down, but only as the amplitudes of the resulting measured states."
