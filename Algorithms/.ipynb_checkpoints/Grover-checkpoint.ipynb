    "Grover's Algorithm is a non-deterministic Quantum Algorithm proposed by Lov Grover in 1996, that is usually known to solve the problem of \"Searching a element into an unsorted database\", which with high probability finds the searched given element, using just $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N})$ queries. The analogous classical solution for this same problem needs at the worst case $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ operations.\n",

The main idea of the algorithm, consists in marking the given element such as its probability of measurment is increased, which will be done by guess what? Our dear friend the $U_f$ function $f:\\{0, 1\\}^n \\rightarrow \\{0, 1\\}$, which is pretty much the same that is done in Deutsch-Josza algorithm, if your a not familiar with his idea, I strongly recommend you to take a look in the [Deutsch-Josza Algorithm](https://github.com/matheusmtta/Quantum-Computing/blob/master/Algorithms/Deutsch-Josza.ipynb) Notebook.\n",
