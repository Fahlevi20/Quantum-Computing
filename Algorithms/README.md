# Quantum Algorithms

In this session of the repository you will find detailed explanations about Quantum Computing Algorithms and its respectives implementations using IBM Qikist and more later I will be adding the Microsoft Q# Implementations as well.

I still adding the algorithms notebooks, and I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU to download the notebooks to get a better experience on reading and understanding them.

## Algorithms
* [Deutsch-Josza Algorithm](https://github.com/matheusmtta/Quantum-Computing/blob/master/Algorithms/Deutsch-Josza.ipynb)
* [Grover's Algorithm](https://github.com/matheusmtta/Quantum-Computing/blob/master/Algorithms/Grover.ipynb) 
* [Quantum Fourier Transform]()
* [Quantum Phase Estimation]()
* [Shor's Algorithm]()
