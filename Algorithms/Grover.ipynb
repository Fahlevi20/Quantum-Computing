    "Grover's Algorithm is a non-deterministic Quantum Algorithm proposed by Lov Grover in 1996, that is usually known to solve the problem of \"Searching a element into an unsorted database\", which with high probability finds the searched given element, using just $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N})$ queries. The analogous classical solution for this same problem needs at the worst case $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though Grover's Algorithm doesn't give us a exponential speedup, this Quantum approach still provide us a quadratic improvement over the classical solution, which is still pretty useful when dealing with large $N$ inputs, and as already shown by Bennett, Bernstein, Brassard, and Vazirani Grover's algorithm is asymptotically optimal, since any quantum solution for the same problem needs at least $\\Omega(\\sqrt{N})$ queries."
